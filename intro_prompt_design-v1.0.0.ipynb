      "* **Composition:** The planet is composed of a solid inner core, a liquid outer core, a mantle, and a thin crust. \n",
      "* **Atmosphere:** Earth has a protective atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). \n",
      "* **Hydrosphere:** About 71% of Earth's surface is covered in water, forming oceans, lakes, rivers, and ice.\n",

      "* **Magnetic Field:**  Earth has a magnetic field generated by the movement of its liquid iron core, protecting us from harmful solar radiation.\n",

    "Another way to improve response quality is to add examples in your prompt. The LLM learns in-context from the examples on how to respond. Typically, one to five examples (shots) are enough to improve the quality of responses. Including too many examples can cause the model to over-fit the data and reduce the quality of responses.\n",

    "Similar to classical model training, the quality and distribution of the examples is very important. Pick examples that are representative of the scenarios that you need the model to learn, and keep the distribution of the examples (e.g. number of examples per class in the case of classification) aligned with your actual distribution."
