    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge lab is designed to test your knowledge of calling Gemini and utilizing a few fundamental text prompt design techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two featured guides on prompting from the Google Cloud documentation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Overview of prompting strategies](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/prompt-design-strategies) from the Generative AI on Vertex AI documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Prompt design strategies](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-strategies) from the Gemini API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both contain good tips. You are encouraged to **bookmark them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "You will demonstrate your ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize Vertex AI in your environment\n",
    "- Load a generative model\n",
    "- Guide model output with a persona\n",
    "- Extract information to a schema\n",
    "- Stay on topic with fallback responses\n",
    "- Use examples to influence the model's response\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the following Python notebook cells have missing or incomplete code sections and tasks that need to be completed, indicated by the code comments starting with `# TODO`. Your challenge is to complete each cell, run it to test for correctness, and then move on. When all the cells are working, you have completed the challenge.\n",

      "\n",
      "**3. Lunges:** Work your balance and coordination with lunges. Step forward with one leg, keeping your back straight and your front knee aligned with your ankle. Lower your body until your front thigh is parallel to the ground, then push back up to the starting position.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Leg Press:** This machine allows you to safely overload your legs. Push the platform away with your feet, focusing on extending your legs fully at the top.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Remember:**\n",

      "* **Focus on form:** Proper form is crucial to prevent injuries and maximize results. Watch videos, ask for guidance, and don't be afraid to start with lighter weights.\n",

      "* **Mind-muscle connection:** Focus on feeling the muscles working throughout each exercise.\n",
      "* **Rest and recovery:** Give your legs time to recover between workouts. Aim for at least 48 hours of rest before training them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bonus:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Jump Squats:** Add an explosive element to your squats by jumping at the top of the movement.\n",
